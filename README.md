# Char-CNN-for-Text-Classification
Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification  

# Introduction
This code mainly implement the paper [Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01626)(Char CNN)

I find this image rather difficult to understand. So I redrawn the following image according to my own understanding.

In actually, Char CNN is the same as conventional CNN (for image).
